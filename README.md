# youclan: A Social Network for UCLan Students

![image](./screenshots/01.png)



New students of the University of Central Lancashire may often face difficulties establishing connections with their peers, largely because of the lack of a common medium of communication. This is even more relevant today, in 2020, now that the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the physical presence of students to a minimum. A social media focused entirely on UCLan can help to connect students with similar interests, courses and outlooks.



### Registration

The way we tackle user registration and verification is simple: we take advantage of the existing university student account system. Users can register only using their university username. We then verify that by sending an e-mail to the corresponding university mail account. 



After verification, users must complete their profile with information about the degree they are undertaking, and optionally a profile picture.

### Interactivity

The central aspect of *youclan* is the ability to create posts. Said posts can be either composed of text and/or an image. Additionally, youtube links are parsed and displayed in video form. Users are also able to comment under posts, and upvote posts and comments. Our version of the like or upvote is the Lancashire rose, which has been part of UCLan's identity.




### Profiles

Due to time constraints a "friend" system could not be implemented. Ideally the left bar should show the user's friends/contacts. Currently it lists every user registered in the database.



After clicking on one of the profiles on the sidebar, or the user that made a post/comment, their profile page will be shown, along with their basic information.
